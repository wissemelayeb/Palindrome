This function takes in a word as an argument and checks whether the word is a palindrome or not. 
A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards and backwards.

To determine if the word is a palindrome, the function first converts the word to lowercase. 
Then, it initializes two counters, i and j, which are used to iterate through the word from both ends. 
If the length of the word is less than or equal to 1, the function returns true since single letters are considered palindromes.
